# blender-mickey-onlyfun

very basic mickey mouse 
learnt how to set up the scene (kinda not really)
just click on diff parts and messages will pop up
code is chaotic
future improv-
improve the model
make the code less chaotic
add styling to the text 
remove popups and make those into something else
